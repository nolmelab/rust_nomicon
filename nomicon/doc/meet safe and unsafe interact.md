# meet safe and unsafe interact

Rust contains both a safe and unsafe programming language.

There are still some problems â€” most notably, we must become aware of properties that the 
type system assumes and audit them in any code that interacts with Unsafe Rust. That's 
the purpose of this book: to teach you about these assumptions and how to manage them.
